NEW BACKGROUND IMAGES!!!!
Previous attempts produced cascades that falsly identified other signs such as Do Not Enter and Hospital signs as stop signs
Images of these signs were used to generate a large number (1000) of negative images containing these signs in an attempt to train the 
cascade to ignore them. The same positive images were used.

Notes: 
Negative images consist of landscapes and cityscapes/streets as well as some images of people and sings
Two different stop signs were used to generate positive images....don't know if this makes a difference
Changed mode to all to capture some 45 degree features since the stop sign has angled edges. Hope to help differentiate stop signs from do not enter signs

--> Seems to work better than the HAAR cascade trained with the same parameters, fewer false positives <--
